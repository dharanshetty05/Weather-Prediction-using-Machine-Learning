# Weather Prediction

## Overview

This project focuses on predicting weather temperatures using machine learning techniques. It includes data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis, and implementing multiple regression algorithms for prediction.

## Setup

Ensure you have the necessary packages installed in your Python environment. The required packages include:

- numpy
- pandas
- matplotlib
- scikit-learn

You can install them using pip:

```bash
pip install numpy pandas matplotlib scikit-learn
```

## Usage

1. Clone or download the repository.
2. Ensure you have Python installed on your system.
3. Open the Jupyter Notebook file `WEATHER_PREDICTION.ipynb` in your Jupyter Notebook environment or any compatible platform.
4. Execute the cells in the notebook sequentially to see the process of weather prediction using machine learning algorithms.
5. You may need to adjust file paths if you're using data from a different source.

## Description

- The notebook starts with importing necessary packages for data manipulation and visualization.
- It reads a CSV file containing weather data and preprocesses it for analysis.
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) is performed to understand the distribution and relationship between different weather parameters.
- The dataset is split into training and testing sets.
- Multiple linear regression, decision tree regression, and random forest regression algorithms are implemented and evaluated.
- Evaluation metrics such as mean absolute error, mean squared error, and R2 score are calculated for each model.
- Plots are generated to visualize the relationship between temperature and other weather parameters.

## Results

- Multiple linear regression, decision tree regression, and random forest regression models are trained and evaluated.
- Evaluation metrics are calculated to assess the performance of each model.
- Visualizations help in understanding the relationship between different weather parameters and temperature.

## Acknowledgments

- Inspiration and guidance for implementing machine learning algorithms are derived from various online resources and documentation.
